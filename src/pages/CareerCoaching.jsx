			<h2>Unleash the Potential of You</h2>
			<p>
				Career coaching helps you plan the steps to achieve your life goals. Those that know what
				they are trying to achieve can align their personal development and role choices to meet the
				path laid out.
			</p>
			<p>Career coaching comes in three primary stages;</p>
			<h3>Aspiring</h3>
			<p>
				For young people who are probably in their first role, and have reached the stage where they
				are trying to decide what comes next. Typical questions Aspiring people ask themselves
				include;
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do I stay where I am and seek promotion, or move on?</li>
				<li>Have I made the right choice of career, or do I want to change?</li>
				<li>Do I want to enter People Management, or develop as an Expertise Leader?</li>
				<li>
					What self-development should I be doing and how can I easily access quality materials?
				</li>
				<li>How do my personal goals fit with my career goals?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Getting the career foundations settled facilitates strong decision making, and also helps
				employers see the plan you have made and the achievements along that path.
			</p>
			<h3>Strengthening</h3>
			<p>
				For people established in their career, looking to grow and get more senior roles, or maybe
				thinking of a change and starting a new path. Typical questions Strengthening People ask
				themselves is;
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Am I on the right path, or is it time to change and go in another direction?</li>
				<li>
					I have been employed for some time, I know what I am doing, so is it time to strike out on
					my own?
				</li>
				<li>What post-graduate qualifications do I aim to complete?</li>
				<li>How do I get to the next stage in the career hierarchy?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For some this is a time to kick on and capitalise on experience gained, and for others, it
				is a time to challenge themselves and create a new path. Wherever you sit, we can help you
				gain direction, focus and a plan to succeed.
			</p>
			<h3>Strategic</h3>
			<p>
				For people in more senior roles, who have enjoyed success in their career often face
				challenging decisions on entering the latter stages of a career, and are planning longer
				term and into retirement. Typical questions Strategic people ask themselves include;
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How do I plan for retirement?</li>
				<li>What will I need to have the life I want for myself and my family?</li>
				<li>How do I balance life and work?</li>
				<li>What options do I have in my career?</li>
				<li>Is it time to go and do something more for me?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The Strategic stage of your career is not about age. It reflects growing responsibilities,
				higher demands on income, and the need to plan for the future to meet your personal, family
				and business needs.
			</p>
			<p>Career coaching will help you to;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Analyse where you are, and where you want to be.</li>
				<li>Set goals for your personal life, family life and business life.</li>
				<li>Confront limiting beliefs and other constraints.</li>
				<li>Build out the steps to take to achieve your goals</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>How Do we do it?</h2>
			<h3>Diagnose</h3>
			<p>
				This is an investigation of your situation. It involves you describing what is happening and
				what is not happening, and you coach seeking clarification. At the end we understand what
				your goals are and you can set your objectives.
			</p>
			<h3>Ideate</h3>
			<p>
				Now you understand what it is you are trying to do, the next part of the process is to
				create ideas on potential actions. We explore what could be done, any development you need
				and identify support structures.
			</p>
			<h3>Propose</h3>
			<p>
				You now move the ideas into actions with a plan that accounts for the actions, tasks,
				development and support needed. You will also work on the change and communication plan,
				making sure that you can bring all stakeholders along with you..
			</p>
			<h3>Execute</h3>
			<p>
				You take the proposal and implement it, evaluating using the measures and objectives we
				formed earlier.
			</p>
			<h3>Review</h3>
			<p>
				The final stage is for you to review your progress and look again to the future, knowing
				what has worked and what still requires work.
			</p>
			<h2>Want to find out more?</h2>
			<p>
				Before we get into the formal process, we start with an informal chat to establish if we are
				a good fit to collaborate. In this meeting we will agree what happens next and the fee
				structure and payment process.
