						Running a business takes knowledge, energy, communication and imagination. It also takes
						up all of your time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Large organisations have support structures where you can get help, but when you run a
						small business it can feel like you have to solve every problem yourself, and it can be
						a lonely place.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is where business coaching comes in. Business coaching is not about telling you how
						to run your business, it is about drawing from you a way forward and a plan to succeed.
